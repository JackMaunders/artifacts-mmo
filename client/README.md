# Artifacts MMO Controller - Client

Created using Vite, this is the UI of the applications which you can interact with to perform moves/action in game

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes

## Installation

To install dependencies, run:

```sh
$ npm install
```

## Usage

### Serving the app locally

```sh
$ npm run dev
```

### Building

```sh
$ npm run build
```

This task will create an application bundle to be served over a static hosting service inside your local `dist/` folder

### Previewing the build locally

```sh
$ npm run preview
```

This will use `vite preview` which boots up a local static web server that serves the files from `dist` at `http://localhost:4173`

*Note* this requires [Building](#building) first.
